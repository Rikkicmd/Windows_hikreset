Steps
1. Set the IP of computer as 192.0.0.128 with subnet 255.255.255.0
2. Recorder IP can be anything (You cant change it anyway if your locked out)
3. Make sure Recorder is turned ON.
4. Run the tftpserv.exe file.
5. Power OFF the recorder wait 5 seconds and then power ON the Recorder. The Recorder will search the new firmware and upgrade it automatically. 
6. Wait until TFTP shows "Device [192.0.0.64] system update completed!" It takes a few minutes.
7. Close the TFTP program before the recorder reboots.
8. Recorder will restart automatically after upgrading.
9. You will hopefully get a setup wizard page if you have a monitor plugged in, if not it should be seen as needing activating on SADP software.


If this doesnt work due to the firmware file being too large, I can give you another program to use but it needs to be ran in Linux.
